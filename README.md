Griepum app
===========

Introduction
------------
Griepum is a (Dutch) app for Android. This app can be used as a geographic game in which the 
use of smartphones/tables is required. The game has a simple concept: an agent has to catch a
 thief (boef/dief). The agents can see the thieves on a map, but only once per specified time
 interval. The agents are always visible on the map. So the thieves can see the agents at all
 times.
